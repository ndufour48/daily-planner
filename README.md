# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This is a simple work day scheduler for standard bussiness hours. 

## Usage
When opening the planner, you will be greeted with today's date. Below that, you will see time blocks for standard business hours. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is the past(grey), present(red), or future(green). You click into each time block and type an event, appointment, meeting, etc. After editing your event, you can click the save button to save to your local storage.
